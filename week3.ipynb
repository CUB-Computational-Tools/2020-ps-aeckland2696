    "\n",
    "In Sedimentology, it is important to understand the concept of textural maturity as it pertains to clastic sedimentary rocks. The purpose of this notebook is to introduce the four basic characteristics of clastic sedimentary rock texture. The 4 key characteristis include:\n",
    "- Textural maturity\n",
    "- Grain size\n",
    "- Grain sorting\n",
    "- Roundness & sphericity"

    "#### Textural Maturity\n",
    "\n",
    "Textural maturity is an important textural characteristic. Recall that sedimentary texture is defined as the physical characteristics of grains and matrix. Textural maturity, however, is a concept that sums up the textural state of a sediment. Sediment becomes increasingly mature in 3 steps (with increasingly more work done from 1-3):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Winnowing (washing out) of fines** - size segregation; happens relatively easily near source area\n",
    "2. **Sorting of framework grain sizes** - greater total energy worked and further segregates sediment\n",
    "3. **Rounding** - takes even more transport (total energy) than washing out or sorting. Maximum rounding is a rare phenomena. \n",
    "\n",
    "Textural maturity integrates the amount of matrix, sorting, and roundness of a clastic sedimenatry rock. Supermature is characterized by rounded clasts of uniform grain size and no matrix. Immature sediments are the antithesis. The categories of textural maturity are: immature, submature, mature, and supermature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow chart below is used for classyfing the textural maturity of clastic sedimentary rocks. We will be using flow control with Python to convert the visual flow chart into a conditional statement, which will be discussed further in the programming section. "

    "In the context of most data science work, Python for loops are used to loop through an iterable object (like a list, tuple, set, etc.) and perform the same action for each entry. For example, a for loop would allow us to iterate through a list, performing the same action on each item in the list. \n",

    "\n",
    "You create a for loop by first defining the *iterable object you’d like to loop through*, and then defining the *actions you’d like to perform on each item in that iterable object*. For example, when iterating through a list, you first specify the list you’d like to iterate through, and then specify what action you’d like to perform on each list item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at a quick example: if we had a list of sedimentary rock types stored in Python, we could use a for loop to iterate through that list, printing each name until it reached the end. Below, we’ll create our list of rock types, and then write a for loop that iterates through it, printing each entry on the list in sequence."

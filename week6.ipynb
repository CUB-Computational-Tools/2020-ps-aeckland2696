    "## Lesson Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will go over what governs and how to calculate the temperature profile in the Earth's crust, aka the geothermal gradient, or better yet, the geotherm. It is important to constrain the temperature profile within the near-surface Earth in order to interpret exhumation histories from thermochronology, for predicting the depth of permafrost (permantently frozen ground), and to potentially deduce the temperature history of the Earth's surface. It turns out, many near-surface processes are driven by changes in temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will not be deriving the steady geotherm equation together, but note that the following equation denotes the steady geotherm:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T = \\overline{T_s} + \\frac{Q_m}{k}*z$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\overline{T_s}$ is the average temperature at the surface in $^\\circ C$, $Q_m$ is the mantle-derived heat flux in $W/m^2$, $k$ is the thermal conductivity in $W/m^\\circ K$, and $z$ is the depth in meters. Mantle-derived heat flux is essentially the primordial heat left over from Earth's formation, and thermal conductivity is a measure of the intrinsic ability of a material to conduct heat. \n",
    "\n",
    "By steady state, we mean that the rate of temperature change with depth is not changing, and the only heat source being considered is the mantle-derived heat flux. Heat generated from radioactive decay is not included in this equation. Therefore, the temperature profiles we calculate and figures we plot will show a linear relationship of temperature with respect to depth. The $\\frac{Q_m}{k}$ part of the equation is the slope of the geotherm and describes the temperature gradient in $\\frac{^\\circ C}{m}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the simplest equation for calculating the geotherm. Note that effects from radioactivity, depth (and hence, pressure), differential conductivity of subsurface material, and other factors can all lead to \"kinks\" in the geotherm. We will be evaluating the steady geotherm in the near subsurface, within only 10 kms of the surface, so we do not expect to see any kinks in today's lesson. The figure below shows what the geotherm looks like from the surface all the way to the inner core of the Earth."

    "- **Function Name** - This is the actual name of the function. It is stored in R environment as an object with this name.\n",
    "- **Arguments** - An argument is a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the argument. Arguments are optional; that is, a function may contain no arguments. Also arguments can have default values.\n",

However, variables defined outside functiuons can still be accessed within a function, and have a *global scope*. Variables with a global scope cannot be modified inside the function. If you want to modifity that variable's value inside the function, it should be passed in as an argument. \n",

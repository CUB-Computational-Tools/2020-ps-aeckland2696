    "## Lesson Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will go over what governs the temperature profile in the Earth's crust. It is important to constrain the temperature profile within the near-surface Earth in order to interpret exhumation histories from thermochronology, for predicting the depth of permafrost (permantently frozen ground), and to potentially deduce the temperature history of the Earth's surface. It turns out, many near-surface processes are driven by changes in temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will not be deriving the steady geotherm equation together, but note that the following equation denotes the steady geotherm:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T = \\overline{T_s} + \\frac{Q_m}{k}*z$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\overline{T_s}$ is the average temperature at the surface in $^\\circ C$, $Q_m$ is the mantle-derived heat flux in $W/m^2$, $k$ is the thermal conductivity in $W/m^\\circ K$, and $z$ is the depth in meters. Mantle-derived heat flux is essentially the primordial heat left over from Earth's formation, and thermal conductivity is a measure of the intrinsic ability of a material to conduct heat. \n",
    "\n",
    "By steady state, we mean that the rate of temperature change with depth is not changing, and the only heat source being considered is the mantle-derived heat flux. Heat generated from radioactive decay is not included in this equation. Therefore, the temperature profiles we calculate and plot will be linear with respect to depth. The $\\frac{Q_m}{k}$ part of the equation is the slope of the geotherm and describes the temperature gradient in $\\frac{^\\circ C}{m}$."

    "## Programming Background\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions** are a useful tool in programming where we can take what we already know how to do and put it in a container that allows us to use it again and again. Functions are quite simple. We will go over the parts of a function next.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function Header\n",
    "\n",
    "A function header is the first line of a **function definition**. It always starts with the keyword *def*. Then, the **function name** is called, which follows the same naming conventions as variables. Immediately after the function name are *parentheses*, which may or may not include arguments separated by commas. **Arguments** are values that are passed in as **inputs** when the function is called, and are used in the function body. The function doesn't always take arguments, and when this is the case, parentheses are left empty. The header always ends with a colon.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function Body \n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the function is contained within the body, where the function does its work. The **body** of a function is the code indented after the header line. within this body, we can refer to the **argument** variables and define new variables, which can only be used within the indented lines. The body will often include a return statement, which is used to send back an **output value** from the function to the statement that called the function. A **return statement** consists of the *return* keyword followed by an expression that is evaluated to get the output value for the function. If there is no return statement, the function simply returns \"None\". \n",

    "### Variable Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variable scope** refers to which parts of a program a variable can be referenced, or used, from. We must consider scope when using variables in functions. If a variable is created inside a function, it can only be used within that function. These variables have *local scope*. Accessing it outside that function is not possible. However, variables defined outside functiuons can still be accessed within a function, and have a *global scope*. Variables with a global scope cannot be modified inside the function. If you want to modifity that variable's value inside the function, it should be passed in as an argument. \n",

    "### Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Documentation** is used to make code easier to understand and use. Functions are especially readable because they use documentation strings, or docstrings. Docstrings are a type of comment used to explain the purpose of a function, and how it should be used. Docstrings are surrounded by triple quotes. The first line of the docstring is a brief explanation of the function's purpose. If you feel that this is sufficient documentation, you can end the docstring at this point; single line docstrings are perfectly acceptable. However, if you think that a longer description is more appropriate, you can add more linformation after the one-line summary. Docstrings are entirely optional, but are a part of good coding practice.\n",

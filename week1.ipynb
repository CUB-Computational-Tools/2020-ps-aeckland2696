The particles of the medium oscillate back and forth about a fixed position. The time which it takes for such a particle to complete one full cycle is known as the ***period***. Period units are simply seconds (or minutes or hours or some time unit). The ***frequency*** of a wave describes the number of complete cycles which are completed during a given period of time. As such, frequency is a rate quantity which describes the rate of oscillations or vibrations or cycles or waves on a per second basis. A common unit of frequency is the Hertz, abbreviated as Hz. A Hertz indicates the number of complete cyles per second.\n\nThere is a mathematical relationship between the frequency $(f)$ of the wave and the period $(T)$ of the wave as denoted by the following relationship:\n\n$$f = 1 / T$$\n\nKnowing frequency allows one to automatically calculate the period, and vice versa.\n\n#### Wave Speed\nWaves propagate through a medium. The familiar pattern of the sine wave consists of a ***crest*** and a ***trough***. The crest can be seen moving along the medium from one location to another location. The ***speed*** (or velocity) of a wave is defined as the distance a crest on the wave travels per unit of time. Like the speed of a runner or a car, wave speed $(v)$ is simply the ratio of the distance $(d)$ traveled per time of travel $(t)$ as shown by the following equation.\n\n$$v = d / t$$\n\n#### The Anatomy of a Wave\nImagine a wave moving through a medium such as a rope or snakey. And then imagine that a snapshot could be taken at an instant in time, thus freezing the motion of the wave and providing a picture of the shape of the medium. The result would be a diagram similar to that below (of course, without all the labels). \n\nThe labels have been added to indicate a few strategic points. The dashed line which stretches horizontally across the middle of the pattern is known as the ***rest position***. The points labeled crests are at the points of maximum displacement above the rest position; the troughs are at the points of maximum displacement below the rest position. The vertical distance from a crest to the rest position is known as the ***amplitude***. The vertical distance between the crest and the trough of a wave is known as the ***wave height***. And the horizontal distance stretching between any two adjacent crests (or between adjacent troughs) is known as the ***wavelength***.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Wave Anatomy](2020-ps-aeckland2696/data/wave_anatomy.jpg)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### The Wave Equation\nThere is a mathematical relationship between the speed or velocity $(v)$ of a wave and the frequency $(f)$ and wavelength $(λ)$ of the wave.
